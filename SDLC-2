PeopleSafe SDLC daily journal. 


This is a spin on The G.L.A.D. Technique, developed by Donald Altman as a particularly useful approach in developing a grateful attitude towards life (see The Mindfulness Toolbox, New Harbinger Publications). 
SDLC is a common phrase in software development and cybersecurity, Playing off the opportunity to recast this as a methodology to support good mental health and finding the good in your day that may be hard when not a conscious actions.
The G.L.A.D Technique uses the following:
Gratitude
Learning
Accomplishment
Delight
...

I have chosen SDLC to help reinforce both the proposed process for elevating positive thinking, but to reaffirm the foundational importance of SDLC (software/security development life cycle) to IT.
My proposed SDLC Technique uses the following:
Success
Delight
Learning
Compliment

Both techniques are focused on daily directed journaling of 4 key reflections. 
Where did I have success today?
What brought me delight today?
What did I learn today?
And what can I compliment about my day?

Each of these items does not need to be large in scope or scale. They can be very small things or giant things. The importance is on recognizing and documenting
the positives in these four areas daily, over a period of time, to increase your awareness of your own positive impacts and how positive impacts can help you change
your perspective to a more postive one.

More details are being worked on to provide a usable tool and to delve deeper into this topic. I have a worksheet template in process and suggestions on how to make this a simple daily practice.
